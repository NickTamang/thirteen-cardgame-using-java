Introduction:
This document is based on the overall testing of my codes which will provide the detailed walkthrough
the java classes, loops, codes, methods, and overall output of this application as a test. I will be testing
overall game including the main menu, start, hint, replay, win or lose, demonstration mode, wrong user
input and exit.

1. Main menu:
This is the testing of menu of the game: Thirteen where user is asked to make a selection from 1-3. I
have the main menu of the game interactive to the user with various decoration using emojis acting like
GUI.

2. Player name:
The game which I have created asks the user to input player name later after the starting of the
game, it greets the player with the player’s name which makes this game interactive to the user
and design friendly.3. Single Card Elimination & Double Card Elimination:
After the initial 10 cards are shown, the player is asked to eliminate the single or double cards that
makes sum 1

3. So, here the King is eliminated by selecting the option 1 and selecting the position in the
second selection.
Similarly, the User can eliminate the double card as well if it satisfies the condition sum of 2 cards equals
to 13. And here, the option 2 is for elimination of double card by selecting the position of first and
second card respectively.

4. Hint:
This is the most interesting part of the game where if player cannot find the possible moves in his/her
sight then it helps the player see the next possible hint if game in not over.


5. Winning/Loosing the game and replaying each moves made:
After all the 52 cards from deck is played then according to rule the player wins the game which gives
nice output as a celebration. And the player can also see each move made throughout the whole game
by just pressing the enter key.

6. Demonstration mode/Computer play:
Testing of demo mode had been made easier to the player as the player just have to give input 2 to
select the demo option from menu and keep pressing enter to see the final result of computer as loose
or win.

7. Handling of Wrong user input:
I have tested the outcome of wrong user input because the good application should be capable of
handling every error possible. So, even if the user gives the random input then the program allows users
to make selection again by printing error message.
e.

8. Exit the game:
This is the testing of the exit of the game by selection of 3 from the main menu. As soon as the Player
exits the game, player sees the message” Thank you for playing the game”.


Conclusion:
After the successful testing of the game I have created card game: Thirteen, No any errors were found
on the game. At first there were lots of error that I had to face in the process of making of this game but
after minimizing the errors, the game came out with the design to provide an interactive user
experience to the player with the good design arranged user interface with no errors/game crash.
